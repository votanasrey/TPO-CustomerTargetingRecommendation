# Trade Program Optimization & Customer Targeting Recommendation
Trade Program Optimization is the initiative project from Data and Analytic team to support the trade marketing and sale team to optimize the key performance indicator of them and increase the sale volume of the company as well. Trade Program Optimization is the initiative project from Data and Analytic team to support the trade marketing and sale team to optimize the key performance indicator of them and increase the sale volume of the company as well. By doing this project, we have a model and analyze the root cause of decrease and increase reason of each trade program that implementing in the marketing and after that. Moreover, that’s not only one thing that our model helps to the stakeholder’s team and company, but it will also support the team to get the right target customers to fit their trade program scheme and KPI that they set. It’s generally involved the many teams such as Data & Analytic Team, Sale Team, Trade Marketing Team, Branding Team, Inventory Management Team, and Digital & Technology Team as well.

<br> Thus, technically our model will aim to combine both the estimation of the target customer and the optimization of targeted promotions over the graph. For this purpose, we need to ensure that the target customer can be optimized over. Therefore, we construct the target customer recommendation model that can be represented by an interpretable graph model describing by how much one customer’s purchase increases the probability of another customer’s purchase, sale volume and make more profit to the company.

The Trade Program Optimization has the object to support the trade marketing to do the program to the right customers effectively. Moreover, Trade Marketing Team is currently quite well doing on the customer program targeting but the problem is we don’t have the standard recommendation to them to improve the trade program targeting and optimization as well. Thus Data & Analytic Team has come up an idea to assist TM to solve this out to increase the sell volume and company KPI as well. The objectives would be:

•	Improve the trade program targeting effectively 
•	Increase the sell volume and profit generate by trade program optimization model
•	Understand the customer’s performance & behaviors
•	Improve the master data and data model & what the need to push master data help the trade program targeting.

<br> Academic/Practical Relevance: From an academic point of view, we want to develop the model to detect the customer targeting effect solely from transactional data and optimal program targeting as well.
